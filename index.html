    <h1> Anime </h1>
      </section>
    <p1> I love anime. I cut him down so he'll spring back up. The boy's enormously talented, there's no denying that. But he's a novice. He's not yet learned how to be worthy of that talent. He refuses to meet any challenge except on his own terms. He doesn't see the true value of competition. To a young person for whom everything comes easily, the pain of defeat can be a much needed wake-up call. this is the speech of a japanese plainly styled cartoon that gaained a massive reputation come to this website if you love anime </p1>
